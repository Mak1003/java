# java
Project was to build a expense tracker 
which includes some specific features

1.total expense for day
2. total expense for week 
3total expense for month

all the user data is stored in expense.txt file

#Project is build using OOPs concepts

#File Structure:
Your project should include:

1. Expense.java: Class to represent individual expenses.
2. ExpenseManager.java: Class to manage expenses and file handling.
3. Main.java: The entry point of the application, where the user interacts with the system.
4. expenses.txt: A text file where the expenses are saved.

#How It Works:
Add Expense: Prompts the user to enter the amount, category, and description, then stores this in the file.
View Summaries: Allows the user to view the total expenses for the day, week, or month.
File Handling: Data is saved to and loaded from expenses.txt to ensure the user's expense history is preserved.
